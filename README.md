# websitechecker

This is a quick project to create an simple website monitor in Python3, this will being with a simple uptime check to ensure that the website is up and is returning status 200 (ok).

I currently work exclusively in AWS and will likely create a simple Lambda to regularly execute these checks and record the results.
This is to allow monitoring of both public and private endpoints and I plan on documenting this as the intended deployment.

## Planned Features

Response time
Date/Time Stamps
Certificate checks
Custom Headers
